# Synthetic Integration Testing

This directory contains integration tests for the Spectra Gnoland Indexer using synthetic data.

## Overview

The integration tests use a **synthetic data generator** to create realistic blockchain data (blocks, transactions, validators) and test the entire indexer pipeline with a real database connection.

## Running Integration Tests

### Prerequisites

- PostgreSQL/TimescaleDB instance running
- Database schema initialized (run `go run indexer/main.go setup create-db`)
- Test configuration file created


Synthetic data is generated and inserted **one chunk at a time** (500 blocks
per chunk by default). Each chunk's blocks, transactions, and commits are
generated into memory, processed through the real pipeline and inserted into
the database, then freed before the next chunk starts. Peak RAM usage is
therefore proportional to a single chunk rather than the full height range,
so large ranges (100K+ blocks) are now safe to run.

### Quick Start

1. **Create test configuration** (`test_config.yml`):

```yaml
host: localhost
port: 5432
user: postgres
password: 12345678 # do not use password default unless for development or testing!!!
dbname: gnoland
sslmode: disable
pool_max_conns: 50
pool_min_conns: 2
pool_max_conn_lifetime: 5m
pool_max_conn_idle_time: 2m
pool_health_check_period: 30s
pool_max_conn_lifetime_jitter: 30s

chain_id: gnoland
from_height: 1
to_height: 1000
```

2. **Run integration tests**:

```bash
# From project root
go test -v -tags=integration ./integration

# Or from integration directory
cd integration
go test -v -tags=integration

# With timeout
go test -v -tags=integration -timeout=10m ./integration
```

## What Gets Tested?

The integration tests exercise:

- **Orchestrator** - Block processing orchestration
- **Data Processor** - Transaction parsing and validation
- **Database Layer** - TimescaleDB insertion and querying
- **Address Cache** - Validator and address caching
- **RPC Client** - Response parsing (using synthetic data)

This provides **almost** entire **data ingestion pipeline** of the indexer. The only thing that is not tested is the RPC client.
